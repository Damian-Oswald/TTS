Okay, so I'm at the store, right? Trying to buy some cereal, and guess what? Every single box of my favorite cereal is at the top shelf. The top shelf! I'm not a giant, you know? So, I'm there, jumping like a kangaroo at a trampoline park, trying to grab a box. And then, this kid walks by, snickers and says, 'Need some help, shorty?' Shorty? I'm not short; I'm average height! Anyway, I ignore the little brat and finally, by some miracle, I get my cereal. But as I'm walking away, triumphant, I slip on a banana peel. A banana peel! Who even eats bananas in a grocery store? And why is it always a banana peel? It's like I'm living in a cartoon! So, there I am, on the ground, covered in cereal because, of course, the box had to burst open. And that kid, oh, that kid, he's laughing so hard I think he's going to burst. I mean, come on! Is this a grocery store or a comedy club? Next time, I'm shopping online. I've had enough of gravity and its shenanigans!
